# iris_flower_classification
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their measured features.
The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset from sklearn.

## Models Implemented
Four supervised ML models were trained on 75% of the data and tested on 25%.
1. Logistic Regression
2. kNN
3. Decision Tree
4. SVM

## Dataset
The sklearn Iris dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:
* Sepal length (cm)
* Sepal width (cm)
* Petal length (cm)
* Petal width (cm)

Target classes:  
0 – Setosa  
1 – Versicolor  
2 – Virginica
